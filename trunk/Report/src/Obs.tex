\chapter{Further Observation and Evaluation}

The majority of this report concentrates on the details of the framework and does not actually use the framework to try produce a quantum algorithm.
This section shall focus on using the framework with the provided suitability measures and search engine to try tackle a few well known quantum problems.

\section{Deutsch Algorithm}
The details of the Deutsch algorithm is presented in Section \ref{sec:DeutAlg}.
The basic aim is to find a way to determine whether the function $f$ is balanced or constant, we can assume it is one of these.

This search problem is slightly unusual as in the test case it is not the input that changes, it is the custom gates.
This results in there are only four test cases for the Deutsch algorithm.
This is due to the Deutsch Algorithm only solving the problem for single qubit functions and therefore there are only four possible binary functions.

This search problem requires custom gates to be used to provide the oracle functions.
These matrices implementing the oracles can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:deutschfunctions}.
The matrices are the unitary operations of a controlled not when the control is provided by the value $f(x)$.
They effectively represent the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:matrepresentation}.
It can be seen that the circuit of the Deutsch Algorithm, Figure \ref{Deutsch-Cir}, includes the circuit represented by the matrices.
The circuit in Figure \ref{fig:matrepresentation} is inverted due to the number of the qubits in the framework.
The matrices have been created taking into account the different qubit numbering so the semantics of the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:matrepresentation} and the respective section of the Deutsch Algorithm circuit in Figure \ref{Deutsch-Cir} are the same.

The start state for each test case is $\ket{10}$.
For functions $1$ and $2$, which are constant, the expected final state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}-\ket{10})$, equivalent to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\ket{0}-\ket{1})\ket{0})$.
For functions $3$ and $4$, which are balanced, the expected final state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01}-\ket{11})$, equivalent to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\ket{0}-\ket{1})\ket{1})$
It is simple to see that, taking into account the different qubit numbering, these are the same output states that are produced by the Deutsch Algorithm in Section \ref{sec:DeutAlg}.

After creating the custom matrices using the provided matrix editor, see Section \ref{sec:indmatrixeditor}, and the test suite using the integrated search problem creator, all elements required for the search were complete.
The search engine that was used was the Q-Pace based search engine, using local threads rather than the JPPF distribution, provided with the framework, see Section \ref{sec:provsearcheng}.
The suitability measure that was used was the Simple suitability measure variant that only reports a ``hit'' for non-zero expected values.

All instructions were included in the search except \emph{Create\_SWAP} and \emph{Create\_Zero}.
All search parameters were kept as the default except time was not used as the seeds to ensure the experiment could be repeated.

The full algorithm that was found is listed in Section \ref{sec:DeutschExpAppFullAlg}.
The algorithm below is a hand optimised version of that listed in \ref{sec:DeutschExpAppFullAlg} with only the instructions that apply when \emph{System\_Size} is $2$.

\begin{lstlisting}
Create_H on gate 0
Create_H on gate 1
Create_Custom1 on gate 1
Create_H on gate 1
\end{lstlisting}

The first instruction is to put a Hadamard gate onto gate $0$.
Gate zero doesn't exist as the qubit numbering is from $1$ upwards.
This is an example of when the Genetic Programming has taken advantage of the environment.
$0$ is used as the value for ``System\_Size'' within the system so as the expression evaluates to $0$ it effectively is instructing that the gate should be put on the ``System\_Size'' qubit.

The circuit that is produced by this algorithm is shown in Figure \ref{fig:evodeutschcir}.
The gate \emph{C0} is the custom unitary operations defined in Figure \ref{fig:deutschfunctions}.

&\qw&\gate{H}&\ghost{C0}&\gate{H}&\\%1
}
\]
\caption{Circuit Produced by Algorithm for Two Qubits}
\label{fig:evodeutschcir}
\end{figure}

It is very clear to see that the search process has found the exact same circuit that was published by Cleve et al\cite{Cleve98quantumalgorithms} and therefore is a deterministic solution.
This is an unprecedented result.
To the best of my knowledge, this circuit has not been produced using search by previous research.
This is also the first time a deterministic algorithm has been found, using search, for either the original Deutsch, single qubit oracles, or Deutsch Josza, multiple qubit oracles, problems.

\section{Deutsch-Jozsa Problem}

After success with the original Deutsch, single qubit, problem the most natural progression is to multiple qubit Deutsch-Josza problem.
The basic aim is the same, to decide if a function is balanced or constant.

In this experiment, the test suite used includes the test cases with oracle functions on $1$ and $2$ qubits.
This results that there are only twelve test cases for the Deutsch algorithm.
Due to the previous experiment, it is known that Genetic Programming can produce a solution to the $1$ qubit problem and it is expected that including these test cases will assist the search.

As with the previous experiment matrices were made to represent the oracle functions.
These matrices for the $2$ qubit oracles are shown in Figure \ref{fig:deutschjozsafunctions} in Section \ref{sec:deutschjozsa}.

The test cases for single qubit oracles, the same test cases as used in the previous experiment is used.
For the two qubit oracles, the test cases that are used all have a staring state of $\ket{100}$.
For $f_1$ and $f_2$ the expected final state is set to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{000}-\ket{100})$.
For $f_3$, $f_4$ ,$f_5$, $f_6$, $f_7$ and $f_8$ the expected final state is set to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(\ket{001}+\ket{010}+\ket{011}-\ket{101}-\ket{110}-\ket{111})$.

The search engine that was used was the Q-Pace based search engine provided with the framework, see Section \ref{sec:provsearcheng}.
The suitability measure that was used was the Simple suitability measure variant that only reports a ``hit'' for non-zero expected values.

Initial experimentation showed that this search problem was significantly harder than the previous experiment.
All instructions were included in the search except \emph{Create\_SWAP}, \emph{Create\_Zero} and \emph{RevIterate}.
The final search parameters used are shown in Figures \ref{fig:deutschjozsaparams} in Section \ref{sec:deutschjozsasearchparams}.
The time was not used as the seeds so this experiment is reproducible.

The full algorithm that was found is listed in Section \ref{sec:DeutschJozsaExpAppFullAlg}.
The algorithm below is a hand optimised version of that listed in \ref{sec:DeutschExpAppFullAlg} with only the instructions that apply when \emph{System\_Size} is $2$.
Instructions marked by an asterisk refer to gates that have been removed from the hand optimised two qubit circuit, Figure \ref{fig:deutjoz2qubits}.

Figures \ref{fig:deutjoz2qubits} and \ref{fig:deutjoz3qubits} show hand optimised versions of the circuit the produced by the algorithm for two and three qubits respectively.
The full circuits that have not been optimised are shown in Section \ref{sec:DeutschJozsaExpAppFullCirs}.
The gate \emph{C0} is the custom unitary operations defined in Figure \ref{fig:deutschjozsafunctions}.
The \emph{C0} gate rendering has also been modified to take into account the knowledge of gate size that the framework cannot assume when producing the QCircuit representation.
The full circuits in Section \ref{sec:DeutschJozsaExpAppFullCirs} are exactly as the framework produced them and therefore do not show the true gate size.
The controls shown in the circuits of Section \ref{sec:DeutschJozsaExpAppFullCirs} are also removed, see Section \ref{sec:quantumgates}.

\end{figure}

Even the hand optimised circuits are not optimal, they contain more calls to the oracle, the \emph{C0} gates, compared to the standard Deutsch-Jozsa circuits, Figure \ref{Deutsch-Jozsa-Cir}.
The Deutsch-Jozsa circuit only use a single call to oracle whereas the circuits in Figures \ref{fig:deutjoz2qubits} and \ref{fig:deutjoz3qubits} make two calls.
The previous attempt made by Spector \emph{et al.}\cite{LSpectorGPforQC,LSpectorANDOR,Spector:1999:QCA:316573.317112} also only used a single call to the oracle.
However, Spector \emph{et al.} placed that restriction on the search and were only searching for the circuit for the 3 qubit problem.
Due to the use of the standard circuit builder provided by the framework, the restriction was not placed on the search process.
The solution found by Spector \emph{et al.} was also only probabilistic whereas the solutions provided here are deterministic.

Even though the circuits use two calls to the oracle, it is possible to see how to transform the circuits produced to use a single oracle call.
% Even though the circuits show that the \emph{C0} gate is controlled, it is not.
% This is because the \emph{C0} gate covers three gates.
% However, due to the flexible nature of the custom gates, when the QCircuit encoding is produced the gate size is unknown so is shown as though it were a single qubit gate.
% When a controlled gate is constructed by the circuit builder, the control is only applied if it is not a qubit that would be acted on by the gate under control.
% If the qubit would be acted on, the effect of the control is removed, see Section \ref{sec:quantumgates}.

In Figures \ref{fig:deutjoz3qubits} the gates are numbered.
It can be reasoned that gate $4$ and $5$ can be swapped due to the matrix equivalent to applying gate $4$ followed by gate $5$ is the same as the matrix equivalent to applying gate $5$ followed by gate $4$.
This would produce two similar portions of the circuit, gates $2$, $3$ and $5$, and gates $4$, $6$ and $7$.


\section{Quantum Fourier Transform}

The most impressive result presented in Massey's thesis\cite{masseythesis} and subject of the subsequent paper\cite{Massey:2005:EHQ:1068009.1068288} was the evolution of an algorithm to produce the Quantum Fourier Transform(QFT).
With the QFT acting as such a central part of Shor's Algorithm, see Section \ref{sec:shorsalg}, it is a very important element for quantum algorithms.

To try reproduce the results found by Massey, the test cases for QFT acting on two and three qubits were initially used.
These were created using Octave\cite{octweb} using Quantum Computing Functions(QCF) for Matlab\cite{qcfweb}.
The input states that were used were all twelve possible non-superpositional states.
All test states are provided in Section \ref{sec:quantfourtransexp}.


The search engine that was used was the Q-Pace based search engine provided with the framework, see Section \ref{sec:provsearcheng}.
The suitability measure that was used was the Phase sensitive suitability measure, see Section \ref{sec:phaseawaresuitmeas}.
The final search parameters used are shown in Figures \ref{fig:qftparams} and \ref{fig:qftgates} in Section \ref{sec:qftsearchparams}.

\section{0..3 Permutation Max Problem}

The $0..3$ permutation problem is used by Massey\cite{masseythesis} to evaluate Q-PACE III.
The problem is quite simple, given a permutation of the numbers $0..3$ give the index of the maximum value, $3$.
Due to the simplicity of the problem it was chosen for the user guide produced for the client provided with the framework, see Section \ref{sec:userguide}.

The interesting feature of the Max problem is that a deterministic solution was not found by Massey for all $24$ possible permutations.
Only a probabilistic solution was found.
The three search problems that have been outlined so far all 


Initial experimentation showed that this search problem was significantly harder than the previous experiment.
All instructions were included in the search except \emph{Create\_SWAP}, \emph{Create\_Zero} and \emph{RevIterate}.
The search parameters used are all the defaults except the mutation rate was set to $0.003846154$, $\frac{0.1}{26}$.
The time was not used as the seeds so this experiment is reproducible.

\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Framework}
\subsection{Complex Numbers}
Complex number representation is provided by class from http://www.math.ksu.edu/~bennett/jomacg/c.html.

\subsection{Matrices}

The Matrix representation is based on the Matrix class provided by the Jama library.
Jama Matrix is modified to provide Matricies of Complex numbers.
The extra funcitonality provided by Jama, such as eigendecomposition, has been disabled currently.
